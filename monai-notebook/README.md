# Monai Notebook

Custom notebook based on RHODS standard data science notebook, adding:

* CUDA, which is a requirement for Monai.

* [Monai](https://monai.io/) ([Github repo](https://github.com/Project-MONAI))

MONAI is a freely available, community-supported, PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. It provides domain-optimized foundational capabilities for developing healthcare imaging training workflows in a native PyTorch paradigm.
Project MONAI also includes MONAI Label, an intelligent open source image labeling and learning tool that helps researchers and clinicians collaborate, create annotated datasets, and build AI models in a standardized MONAI paradigm.

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) ([Github repo](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit))

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.
See [details on Streamlit implementation](../streamlit-notebook/README.md).
