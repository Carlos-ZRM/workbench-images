# Custom notebook images

*[See changelog](CHANGELOG.md)*

Various custom Jupyter Notebook Images to use with [Open Data Hub](http://opendatahub.io/) (ODH) or [Red Hat OpenShift Data Science](https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science) (RHODS).

Images are organized under two main folders:

* [jupyterhub-images](/jupyterhub-images): those images were created to be used with ODH or RHODS with JupyterHub as the launcher (up to ODH1.3 and RHODS ...)
* [notebook-controller-images](notebook-controller-images): those images were created to be used with ODH or RHODS with the Kubeflow Notebook Controller as the launcher (from ODH1.4 and RHODS ...)
